Some days I'm a tidal wave
Still lakes never leave a trace
I'm overcome
but I don't wanna run
Light fades
but the shadows stay
No grace in the breaths I take
I've had enough of staring
at the sun
You wouldn't wanna read my mind
You wouldn't wanna stand
beside me
When I'm living on the edge
Take me to the place
where the heavens are haunted
And I'll pray
to the cross you bear
Tell me, if I gave you the world
would you meet me there?
Do you see me now
the lights are out?
I'm a broken mirror
No sleep in the bed we made
Two saints and a hand grenade
Forever numb, a cry to anyone
Highways over shallow graves
Cold rain down a window pane
I gave you doves
but held on to the gun
You wouldn't wanna read my mind
You wouldn't wanna stand
beside me
When I'm living on the edge
Take me to the place
where the heavens are haunted
And I'll pray
to the cross you bear
Tell me, if I gave you the world
would you meet me there?
Do you see me now
the lights are out?
I'm a broken mirror
These shattered lives
Reflections scattered
Pieces in your eyes
Take me to the place
where the heavens are haunted
And I'll pray
to the cross you bear
Tell me, if I gave you the world
would you meet me there?
Do you see me now
the lights are out?
I'm a broken mirror
I found you on the other side
I tried to put it all behind me
I think about it all the time
I dream about the end
You wouldn't wanna read my mind
You wouldn't wanna stand
beside me
Hear me now, I'm crying out
I'm a broken mirror
