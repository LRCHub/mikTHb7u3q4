It's true, in this life, I've never been the one, in your eyes.
I've never been the truth, all you saw, was a broken mirror.
And it's true, in this life, I've never been the one, in your eyes.
I've never been the truth, all you saw, was a broken mirror.
Yo it's funny when I started people told me I was nothing now they tell me that we been best friends.
And I'm like who are you again I recognize you but you gotta different face looking through a different lens.
I been walking through the game like a black sheep, done it on my own without the press to back me.
But fuck 'em I don't need 'em, I just know that I got me.  I got a small circle and were full of that moxy.
It's never been a secret that you didn't believe in me, so don't be calling when you be needing me and we'll be good, we'll go our separate ways.
What better a day then today to cut bullshit?
I've been moving myself for so long that all I even really know is the grind.
Broken mirrors in my lyrics trying to find myself through all them God dam lines.
I just jotted down abstract, Van Gogh, lost in my thoughts where the fuck did my band go?
Eyes closed, big dreams, radio, swear I'm standing on the edge, vertigo.
So hear the audio and use it as proof, I'm murderous they've never heard of us but neither have you.
So maybe you can introduce yourself and leave a review or maybe not I don't know I'm gonna leave it to you.
It's true, in this life, I've never been the one, in your eyes.
I've never been the truth, all you saw, was a broken mirror.
And it's true, in this life, I've never been the one, in your eyes.
I've never been the truth, all you saw, was a broken mirror.
I pulled the rearview off the glass, I ain't looking back, no.
Pedal to the floor punch a hole in the dash.
I'm a rock n roller I ain't here to follow past.
Sex and drugs, living fast, on the flash, nothing last, I don't answer questions that these suckas ask, no.
Smoke and mirrors around me only get smashed.
First to come I'm the last to leave, that rebel hippie when they see me they pass that way.
How we got this bar, when then spotlights on, and your life in the song, feel calm in the eye of the storm.
No I'm not like the norm, baby I been on this road to long, but I'll be home baby leave them lights on, I'll be there even when I'm gone.
Far from what they said I could, I did more then they said I would, and I ain't finished.
Look into my eyes you don't see no limits, no gimmicks, no pretending, true to my beginning, roots to fine ending.
I'm in the here and now, you ain't believed in me I'll let you down.
It's true, in this life, I've never been the one, in your eyes.
I've never been the truth, all you saw, was a broken mirror.
And it's true, in this life, I've never been the one, in your eyes.
I've never been the truth, all you saw, was a broken mirror.
