At once I'm blinding in the sun
Then in your shadow I am gone
The shattered shards of life long lost
A sharp revenge in years to come

In this blood blessing we are tied
But turn and see another side
A thousand lives are lived in one
Reflections keep what's dead and done

And if I'm seven years, bad luck
Perfection always comes unstuck
See only what you choose to see
You won't know love and you won't know me

At once I'm blinding in the sun
Then nothing when the light in gone
