This stupid fight against aging
Is it worth your life savings?
Skin like a baby, smooth and elastic
A close look shows it's fake and plastic

Life is free
But your living costs a fortune
Pain for a fee
How much did you pay for this torture

If your best friend is the one in your mirror
And if beauty is lot more worth than brain
Seven years of misery is better than a whole life in pain
If you don't like what you see in your mirror
If your life falls apart for an uncoverable stain
Seven years of misery is better than a whole life in pain

So obsessed by retaining your youth
You don't know we're aware of the truth
Our biological clock shows no remorse
Plastic surgery made a good looking corpse

Life is free
But your living costs a fortune
Pain for a fee
How much did you pay for this torture

If your best friend is the one in your mirror
And if beauty is lot more worth than brain
Seven years of misery is better than a whole life in pain
If you don't like what you see in your mirror
If your life falls apart for an uncoverable stain
Seven years of misery is better than a whole life in pain
